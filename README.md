# estim8
Say hello to the ~estim8 web app, my first actual project in my Web Dev journey.  
The project employs Node.js, Express, and EJS, providing me with the much needed exposure to add to my HTML, CSS and JavaScript knowledge.
The app is easy to use, and helps shoppers calculate the real-time cost of their shopping activities as they add new items to their carts. 
The HTML and CSS styling allow responsive web pages, making is possible to use the app on mobile devices.
Regular updates will be made to make the app more robust with the discovery of new ideas and lessons.
